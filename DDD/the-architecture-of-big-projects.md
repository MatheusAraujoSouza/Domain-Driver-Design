# The architecture of big projects 


- Application: This folder contains the code that handles communication between the user interface and the domain layer. It's responsible for receiving user requests, orchestrating interactions between services, and returning responses to the user. In general, the code in the application layer should be simple and focused on coordinating interactions, rather than implementing business logic.

- Service: The service layer contains the business logic of the application. It's responsible for implementing the use cases and business rules that govern the behavior of the application. The service layer typically relies on the domain layer to provide domain objects and abstractions, and may also interact with external systems via the infrastructure layer.

- Infrastructure: This folder contains code that interacts with external systems, such as databases, message queues, and APIs. The infrastructure layer should be designed to be as decoupled as possible from the rest of the application, so that changes to external systems don't have a big impact on the application's internal behavior.

- Domain: The domain layer contains the core domain objects, entities, and value objects that define the business logic of the application. This layer should be designed to be as independent as possible from the other layers, so that changes to the user interface, service layer, or infrastructure layer don't have a big impact on the domain model.

- Library: This folder contains any reusable code or utility classes that are shared across the other layers of the application. This might include helper functions, common data types, or generic implementations of frequently-used patterns.

- Tests: This folder contains automated tests for the application. Ideally, there should be a separate test suite for each layer of the application, so that changes to one layer don't cause unexpected failures in another layer.
