# Real-World analogy 

Let's say you're building a restaurant management system. Here's how each folder might correspond to different parts of the restaurant:

- Application: The application layer would be like the front-of-house staff who greet customers, take their orders, and coordinate with the kitchen staff to make sure the orders are prepared and delivered on time. Just like the application layer, the front-of-house staff are focused on coordinating interactions and making sure everything runs smoothly.

- Service: The service layer would be like the kitchen staff who prepare the food and make sure it's cooked to perfection. Just like the service layer, the kitchen staff are responsible for implementing the business logic (in this case, cooking the food) that governs the behavior of the restaurant.

- Infrastructure: The infrastructure layer would be like the delivery drivers who transport ingredients to the restaurant, or the maintenance crew who keep the kitchen equipment in good working order. Just like the infrastructure layer, these individuals interact with external systems (like suppliers or repair companies) to make sure everything runs smoothly behind the scenes.

- Domain: The domain layer would be like the recipes and cooking techniques that are unique to the restaurant. Just like the domain layer, these recipes and techniques define the core business logic (in this case, the restaurant's menu and cooking methods) that make the restaurant unique.

- Library: The library layer would be like the set of cooking utensils that are shared across the kitchen. Just like the library layer, these utensils (like pots and pans) are reused across many different dishes and help make the kitchen more efficient.

- Tests: The tests folder would be like the restaurant's health inspector who checks to make sure everything is up to code. Just like the tests, the health inspector helps ensure that the restaurant is running smoothly and that there are no hidden problems that could cause issues down the line.

# how is the communication between them ? 

- Application: The application layer can communicate with the service layer to initiate business logic, and can also communicate with the infrastructure layer to access external systems. However, the application layer should not directly communicate with the domain or library layers.

- Service: The service layer can communicate with the application layer to receive requests and return responses, and can also communicate with the domain layer to access core business logic. However, the service layer should not directly communicate with the infrastructure, library, or tests layers.

- Infrastructure: The infrastructure layer can communicate with the application layer to provide access to external systems, but should not directly communicate with the service, domain, library, or tests layers.

- Domain: The domain layer can communicate with the service layer to provide access to core business logic, but should not directly communicate with the application, infrastructure, library, or tests layers.

- Library: The library layer can be accessed by any other layer to provide shared utility classes, but should not directly communicate with the application, service, infrastructure, domain, or tests layers.

- Tests: The tests layer can interact with any of the other layers to provide automated testing, but should not directly communicate with the application, service, infrastructure, domain, or library layers during production use.
