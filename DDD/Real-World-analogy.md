# Real-World analogy 

Let's say you're building a restaurant management system. Here's how each folder might correspond to different parts of the restaurant:

- Application: The application layer would be like the restaurant's ordering system, which allows customers to place orders and coordinates with the kitchen staff to ensure timely delivery of food. Just like the application layer, the ordering system is focused on facilitating interactions and ensuring that orders are processed accurately and efficiently.

- Service: The service layer would be like the head chef and sous chefs who oversee the kitchen staff and ensure that the food is prepared according to the restaurant's standards. Just like the service layer, the head chef and sous chefs are responsible for implementing the core business logic (in this case, cooking the food) and ensuring that it meets the restaurant's quality standards.

- Infrastructure: The infrastructure layer would be like the suppliers who provide the restaurant with ingredients and equipment. Just like the infrastructure layer, these suppliers interact with external systems to ensure that the restaurant has everything it needs to operate smoothly.

- Domain: The domain layer would be like the restaurant's unique menu and culinary style. Just like the domain layer, these elements define the core business logic (in this case, the restaurant's menu and culinary style) that sets the restaurant apart from others.

- Library: The library layer would be like the set of cooking techniques and practices that are shared across the kitchen. Just like the library layer, these techniques and practices (like knife skills and cooking methods) are reused across many different dishes and help make the kitchen more efficient.

- Tests: The tests layer would be like the quality control processes that ensure the food is safe and up to the restaurant's standards. Just like the tests layer, the quality control processes help ensure that the restaurant is running smoothly and that the food meets the restaurant's quality standards.

# how is the communication between them ? 

- Application: The application layer can communicate with the service layer to initiate business logic, and can also communicate with the infrastructure layer to access external systems. However, the application layer should not directly communicate with the domain or library layers.

- Service: The service layer can communicate with the application layer to receive requests and return responses, and can also communicate with the domain layer to access core business logic. However, the service layer should not directly communicate with the infrastructure, library, or tests layers.

- Infrastructure: The infrastructure layer can communicate with the application layer to provide access to external systems, but should not directly communicate with the service, domain, library, or tests layers.

- Domain: The domain layer can communicate with the service layer to provide access to core business logic, but should not directly communicate with the application, infrastructure, library, or tests layers.

- Library: The library layer can be accessed by any other layer to provide shared utility classes, but should not directly communicate with the application, service, infrastructure, domain, or tests layers.

- Tests: The tests layer can interact with any of the other layers to provide automated testing, but should not directly communicate with the application, service, infrastructure, domain, or library layers during production use.



 illustrate the communication between layers in the restaurant management system:


<p align="center"><img src="img/communication-diagran-between-layers.drawio.png" ></p>

Imagine that you are a customer at a restaurant. You sit down at your table and are greeted by a friendly waiter (representing the application layer). You tell the waiter what you would like to eat (representing a request from the application layer to the service layer).

The waiter then goes to the kitchen (representing the service layer) and relays your order to the chef (representing the domain layer). The chef prepares your meal using their secret recipes (representing the core business logic of the domain layer) and sends it back out to the waiter.

The waiter then brings your meal back to your table (representing a response from the service layer to the application layer) and asks if you need anything else (representing further interaction between the application and service layers). You request a glass of water, so the waiter goes to the bar (representing the infrastructure layer) and retrieves a glass of water for you.

Meanwhile, the kitchen staff is using a set of shared utensils (representing the library layer) to prepare other meals for other customers. And in the background, a health inspector (representing the tests layer) periodically checks the restaurant's compliance with health and safety regulations.

Overall, the layers work together seamlessly to provide you with a great dining experience, with each layer focused on its own specific responsibilities.


- Application layer example: The application layer in a restaurant management system could be a tablet application used by the waiter to take orders from customers. This layer can communicate with the service layer to send the order to the kitchen, and can also communicate with the infrastructure layer to access payment systems. For example, the waiter may use the tablet application to send a customer's order to the kitchen and to process their payment using a credit card reader.

- Service layer example: The service layer in a restaurant management system could be a set of APIs that handle incoming requests from the application layer and return responses. For example, the service layer could receive an order request from the tablet application used by the waiter and communicate with the kitchen staff in the domain layer to prepare the order and return a response back to the application layer.

- Infrastructure layer example: The infrastructure layer in a restaurant management system could be the Wi-Fi network used by the tablets and other devices in the restaurant. This layer can communicate with the application layer to provide access to external systems such as payment gateways or inventory management systems. For example, the tablet application used by the waiter needs to connect to the Wi-Fi network to communicate with the service layer and access external systems.

- Domain layer example: The domain layer in a restaurant management system could be the kitchen staff who prepare the food and manage inventory. This layer can communicate with the service layer to access core business logic such as recipes and ingredients. For example, the chef in the kitchen needs to know the recipe for a particular dish and the available ingredients to prepare it.

- Library layer example: The library layer in a restaurant management system could be a set of reusable utility classes that are shared across different layers. For example, a utility class for validating credit card numbers could be used by both the application layer and the infrastructure layer.

- Tests layer example: The tests layer in a restaurant management system could be a set of automated tests that check the functionality and performance of the different layers. For example, an automated test could be used to check that the kitchen staff can handle a high volume of orders during peak hours, or that the payment gateway in the infrastructure layer is functioning correctly.
